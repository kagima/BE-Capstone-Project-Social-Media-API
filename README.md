## 📘 Project Overview

The **Social Media API** is a backend system built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework** that simulates a simple social media platform.  
It allows users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete posts (CRUD)
- Follow and unfollow other users
- View a personalized feed of posts from followed users
- (Planned extensions) Like posts, comment, and receive notifications

This project focuses on **API design, database relationships, user authentication, and secure CRUD operations** — key skills for real-world backend and cybersecurity systems.
